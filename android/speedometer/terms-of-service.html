    <h2>GPS Speedometer Premium<br>Terms of Service</h2>
    <p>
      Effective Date: 2025-07-27
      <br><br>
      By installing GPS Speedometer Premium, you agree to the following terms. Please read them carefully.
      <h2>Definitions</h2>
      "DEVELOPER" - refers to Nclear PROJECT, the developer behind GPS Speedometer Premium
      <br>"SOFTWARE", "APP", "SPEEDOMETER PREMIUM" - refers to the GPS Speedometer Premium application
      <h2>General</h2>
      This software is provided "as-is". The developer assumes no responsibility for any direct, indirect, or consequential damages that may result from use of this application.
      <br>
      While reliability and meticulousness are top priorities, no guarantees are made regarding performance or fitness for any particular purpose. Use this app at your own risk.
      <br><br>
      The app may be updated at any time. As such, uninterrupted access or error-free operation is not guaranteed. If you encounter a software bug, you are encouraged to contact the developer to help resolve the issue.
      <br><br>
      Most mobile device screens are vulnerable to burn-in from prolonged display of static content.
      This is caused by a hardware limitation, and is not an app-related issue.
      <br>To help prevent screen burn-in, the developer implemented a Screen burn-in protection function, which is enabled by default.
      While this feature does not fully prevent burn-in, it is strongly recommended to leave this setting enabled, unless the user explicitly confirms that their device is not affected by burn-in.
      <br>Please note that the developer cannot be held responsible for any screen damage or wear, whether or not this feature is enabled.
      <br><br>
      User privacy remains the developer's top priority. Please refer to <a href="https://ncleardev.github.io/android/speedometer/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> for full details.
      <br><br>
      This software may include links to third-party websites or services. The developer is not responsible for the content, accuracy, or policies of those third-party resources.
      <br><br>
      GPS Speedometer Premium is officially distributed only through the Google Play Store. Users are strongly advised not to download the app from third-party or unofficial sources. Such sources may distribute tampered, outdated, or unsafe versions of the app that could substantially compromise security, privacy, or functionality.
      The developer does not provide support for modified or unofficial versions of GPS Speedometer Premium, and cannot be held responsible for any issues resulting from the use of such versions.
      <h2>Paid Features Overwiew</h2>
      <b><u>All paid features are available only for devices with Android 8.0 (Oreo) or newer. It is not possible to purchase or use the paid features on older versions of Android.
      Please confirm compatibility for every device you intend to use before purchase.</b></u>
      <br><br>
      All application features, including the paid ones, are subject to being modified, improved, or replaced with equivalent functionality over time as the app evolves.
      <br><br>
      Refunds are subject to Google Play's refund policies. Please refer to <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2479637">https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2479637</a> for more information.
      <br><br>
      In addition, Experimental Settings are also offered, which if enabled may cause app crashes, visual glitches, or unexpected behaviour. They are subject to significant change or removal at any time without notice.
      <h2>Premium+</h2>
      In addition to the term above, the following apply to Premium+:
      <br><br>
      This software offers additional features via Premium+ in-app purchase.
      This one-time purchase is processed and managed by Google Play Services.
      <br><br>
      Background Trip Recording requires battery optimization to be disabled for GPS Speedometer Premium.
      <br>
      This permission is not misused - GPS Speedometer Premium will not actively run in a background unless a "Trip recording" notification is being shown. You may stop the background activity at any time by clicking on the "Stop" button in the notification or by closing the app from recents.
      <br>
      By default, to avoid accidental battery drain, a reminder notification will appear after 15 minutes of inactivity.
      <br>
      On some devices - especially when battery saver is active - trip recording may be interrupted periodically. Please consult the official <a href="https://ncleardev.github.io/android/speedometer/help">FAQ & Help page</a> for more details.
      <br><br>
      Window mode utilizes Android's default implementation of picture-in-picture (PiP). PiP might be system-disabled on devices that have low system memory, in which case the Window mode will not work. If that is the case, the app will display a warning on the Premium+ page before purchase. Please confirm compatibility for every device you intend to use before purchase.
      <br><br>
      Music Controller provides universal media playback control and works with most music apps, including the most popular services. However, some outdated or niche apps may be incompatible. To test compatibility, the developer offers a free app on Google Play, "ShadowAmp", allowing you to test the feature in advance.
      Please confirm compatibility for every device and every music app you intend to use before purchase.
      <br>This feature requires a notification access to view information about the currently playing music. As described in the Privacy Policy, this data is not collected and is used for display purposes only.


      <h2>Premium+ Navigator</h2>
      In addition to the terms above, the following apply to Premium+ Navigator:
      <br><br>
      This software offers additional features via Premium+ Navigator subscription.
      This subscription is processed and managed by Google Play Services. Unless cancelled, the subscription renews automatically at the end of each billing period using your preferred payment method on Google Play.
      If you wish to cancel your subscription, you may do so in GPS Speedometer Premium settings, or by heading directly to the subscriptions page in the Google Play Store application.
      <br><br>
      On top of Premium+ Navigator exclusive features, all the standard Premium+ features are also included.
      However please note that if the subscription ends, you will lose access to Premium+ Navigator features, and Premium+ features if standalone Premium+ purchase is not made.
      <br><br>
      The Map view relies on Google Maps SDK, which requires Google Play Services to be installed and updated on the device.
      <br>The use of Google Maps features and content is subject to:
      <br>(1) Google Maps End User Additional Terms of Service <a href="https://maps.google.com/help/terms_maps/">https://maps.google.com/help/terms_maps/</a>;
      <br>and (2) Google Privacy Policy <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>
      <br><br>
      <h2>Final Notes</h2>
      These terms may be updated occasionally. It is your responsibility to check this page for the latest version.
      <br><br>
      By continuing to use this software, you agree to comply with the terms above. If you do not agree, you must stop using the application and remove it from your devices.
      <br><br>
      By making any in-app purchase, you acknowledge that you have reviewed the available feature descriptions and confirmed device compatibility.
